# Australia Weather Prediction
Machine Learning project that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow or not, using historical weather data.

This project builds a complete end-to-end ML pipeline — from data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to saving artifacts, deploying a prediction API,
containerizing the app with Docker, and finally deploying it on Google Cloud Platform (GKE) using CI/CD with GitHub Actions
